What is an "axe"?

---

An axe (or "axe to grind") is the interest that a trader shows in buying or selling a security that is typically already on his books. If a trader holds a long position, but has short-term concerns, that traderâ€™s axe toward short-term put options may be significant. Likewise, if a trader has risk exposure to an increase in interest rates, he may have an axe to hedge against that risk.
